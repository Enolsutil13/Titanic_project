# Titanic_project
 Titanic project with streamlit

The data used in this project has been provided by Upgrade Hub. This dataset has 891 rows and 12 columns, where our variables are:
                       - **PassengerId**: Unique number for each passenger.
                       - **Survived**: Whether passengers survived or not.
                       - **Pclass**: In which class passengers traveled.
                       - **Name**: First and last name, as well as title if they have one.
                       - **Sex**: Gender.
                       - **Age**: Age.
                       - **SibSp**: If passengers have siblins or spouses traveling with them.
                       - **Parch**: If passengers have parents or children traveling with them.
                       - **Ticket**: Ticket number.
                       - **Fare**: Ticket price.
                       - **Cabin**: Cabin number.
                       - **Embarked**: Acronym of the embarkation port.
                       
                       I have cleaned almost 20% of null/NaN data in the 'Age' column, 77% in the 'Cabin' column and 0.2% in the 'Embarked' column.
                       The columns I used the most are: Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Ticket and Embarked 
## REMEMBER ##
I include the file config.toml, which includes colors to visualize the streamlit presentation better. You should copy and paste it in your .streamlit folder, located in your working directory environment or your global directory.
