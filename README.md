 Titanic project with streamlit

The data used in this project has been provided by Upgrade Hub. This dataset has 891 rows and 12 columns, where our variables are:
                       - **PassengerId**: Unique number for each passenger.
                       - **Survived**: Whether passengers survived or not.
                       - **Pclass**: In which class passengers traveled.
                       - **Name**: First and last name, as well as title if they have one.
                       - **Sex**: Gender.
                       - **Age**: Age.
                       - **SibSp**: If passengers have siblins or spouses traveling with them.
                       - **Parch**: If passengers have parents or children traveling with them.
                       - **Ticket**: Ticket number.
                       - **Fare**: Ticket price.
                       - **Cabin**: Cabin number.
                       - **Embarked**: Acronym of the embarkation port.
                       
                       I have cleaned almost 20% of null/NaN data in the 'Age' column, 77% in the 'Cabin' column and 0.2% in the 'Embarked' column.
                       The columns I used the most are: Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Ticket and Embarked
